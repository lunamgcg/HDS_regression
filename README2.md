The hydrodesulfurization (HDS) process is commonly used to remove sulfur compounds from fuels, but eliminating dibenzothiophene (DBT) and its derivatives is challenging. 
This study examines factors affecting catalyst efficiency in HDS of DBT using machine learning (ML) algorithms.
We applied Lasso, Ridge, and Random Forest regression techniques to estimate DBT conversion and selectivity. 
Random Forest and Lasso provided reliable conversion predictions, while regularized regression methods were effective for selectivity.
Key structural parameters, such as pore size and slab length, significantly influence selectivity by affecting active site availability. 
The insights gained from ML techniques are consistent with previous experimental findings.
